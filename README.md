# Financial Dashboard Front-End

Utilising a design from Figma community building this dashboard was a project to test my front-end skills and gain experience with MUI and responsive CSS styling. The design didn't provide any assets so all features were implemented using MUI or custom-built components.

## Dependencies

- npm 8+
- Node.js 16+

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/finnformica/financial-dashboard.git
```

2. Install the requirements:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server and run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Features

- Single Page Application
- React.js
- Static site generation using Next.js
- Candlestick chart loaded with JSON data
- Responsive grid layout
- Dark theme toggle with transition


### Future features:

- Implement trade page with Limit Order Book and spread chart
- Connect the front-end to a source of data to update the prices and portfolio values real-time
